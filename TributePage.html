                    wicket-keeper-batsman. Widely regarded as one of the greatest captain of
                    all time[2][3], he is known for his explosive batting, wicket-keeping and leadership skills.[4] He
                    was the captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs
                    formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He currently plays for and captains

                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian
                    team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014.
                    An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of
                    the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI)
                    debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka

                <h3>Mahendra Singh Dhoni: A timeline</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>December 23, 2004 : Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is run out for 0 after
                        facing one ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.</li>
                    <li>April 5, 2005 : The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and
                        3, Dhoni is sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash
                        148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's 356/9. The
                        world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.</li>
                    <li>October 31, 2005 : Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record 183* against Sri
                        Lanka in Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting at
                        No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in the
                        best-of-seven series.
                    </li>
                    <li>September 13, 2007 : Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is a wash out against
                        Scotland in their ICC World Twenty20 opener. Few could have predicted how India's tournament
                        will pan out.</li>
                    <li>September 24, 2007 : India win the inaugural World Twenty20 by beating Pakistan in an absolute
                        humdinger in Johannesburg. Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the landscape of T20
                        cricket is changed forever.</li>
                    <li>April 2, 2011 : India win the World Cup after 28 years, with the skipper hitting the winning
                        runs with a six. Promoting himself up the order, Dhoni shrugs off his poor run in the tournament
                        with the innings of his life: 91* off 79 balls.</li>
